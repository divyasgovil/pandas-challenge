    "Findings: Average reading score of 76-83  is higher than the math score of 80-84 across schools. There is a greater percentage of students that pass reading vs math. Average math and reading scores are similar among the top 5 charter schools (between 83-84) and lower among the top 5 District schools (76-81). Budgets are higher in the Charter schools than District schools. Top 5 largest schools by student count have lower passing rates of 52-54% whereas Top 5 smallest schools have significantly higher passing rates of 89-90%.e.\n",
