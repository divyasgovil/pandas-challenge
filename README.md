We are the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district. In this capacity, we will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. As a first task, we have been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We have access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Our task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. 
Findings: Average reading score of 76-83  is higher than the math score of 80-84 across schools. There is a greater percentage of students that pass reading vs math. Average math and reading scores are similar among the top 5 charter schools (between 83-84) and lower among the top 5 District schools (76-81). Budgets are higher in the Charter schools than District schools. Top 5 largest schools by student count have lower passing rates of 52-54% whereas Top 5 smallest schools have significantly higher passing rates of 89-90%.
Performed the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
School name, School type, Total students, Total school budget, Per student budget, Average math score, Average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading), Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
Performed the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
Created a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
Used the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary
